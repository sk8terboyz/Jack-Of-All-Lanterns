        We here at Jack of All Lanterns love pumpkin and wish to share our love through our baked goods.
        Founded in 2022, we just want everyone to share the love of pumpkin year round, and will strive 
        to feed pumpkins into pie holes all over the country, even in the midest of spring! Our fresh
        baked pumpkin goods are second to none.
